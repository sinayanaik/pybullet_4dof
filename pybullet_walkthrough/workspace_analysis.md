# Workspace Analysis

This document explains the mathematical and technical approach to analyzing the robot's workspace in the X-Z plane.

## Mathematical Foundation

The workspace analysis is based on forward kinematics and systematic joint space sampling:

1. **Joint Space Sampling**
   - Each joint's range [θₘᵢₙ, θₘₐₓ] is sampled uniformly
   - For n joints and k samples per joint, we evaluate kⁿ configurations
   - Joint angles: θᵢ ∈ [θₘᵢₙ, θₘₐₓ] for i = 1...n

2. **Forward Kinematics**
   - Each configuration (θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ) maps to an end-effector position
   - Position computed through transformation matrices:
     T = T₁(θ₁) × T₂(θ₂) × ... × Tₙ(θₙ)
   - End-effector position = T × [0, 0, 0, 1]ᵀ

3. **Workspace Metrics**
   - X-range: max(x) - min(x)
   - Z-range: max(z) - min(z)
   - Approximate area: X-range × Z-range
   - Point density indicates dexterity

## Implementation Details

1. **Joint Configuration Generation**
   - Uses numpy.linspace for uniform joint sampling
   - numpy.ndindex for efficient iteration over all combinations
   - Complexity: O(kⁿ) where k = samples_per_joint, n = num_joints

2. **Position Computation**
   - Uses PyBullet's forward kinematics engine
   - getLinkState() provides world coordinates
   - resetJointState() updates configuration

3. **Visualization**
   - 2D scatter plot of reachable points
   - Point density reveals manipulability
   - Equal axis scaling for accurate representation

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Sampling Resolution**
   - Higher sampling density increases accuracy but computation time
   - Memory usage grows exponentially with joint count
   - Trade-off between detail and performance

2. **Workspace Properties**
   - Only considers position, not orientation
   - Projects 3D workspace onto X-Z plane
   - Does not account for joint velocity limits

3. **Practical Implications**
   - Dense regions indicate high manipulability
   - Sparse regions may have limited accessibility
   - Boundary points show maximum reach

## Advanced Analysis

1. **Manipulability Analysis**
   - Point density correlates with ease of control
   - Multiple solutions indicate redundancy
   - Useful for identifying optimal working regions

2. **Workspace Optimization**
   - Base placement planning
   - Task feasibility assessment
   - Robot design evaluation

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - Orientation workspace analysis
   - Dynamic constraints consideration
   - Obstacle avoidance integration
